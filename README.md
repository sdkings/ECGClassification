This script(ENG.ipynb) demonstrates how to classify ECG signals using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow and Keras, prepared to work with standard ECG datasets. The script splits the data into training and test sets, applies standardization, and reshapes the data to fit the CNN model. It builds a multi-layer CNN, trains it with a validation split of 0.3 and batch size of 32 for 100 epochs, and evaluates its performance on both the training and test datasets. This model achieved an accuracy of around 99 on both training and testing data. Update the file paths and configurations as needed for your dataset and computing environment.
